### Versatile
It's based on the principle that every website is different. Most CSS frameworks have consistent styling, you can almost tell if a website was designed with a particular one. Here, we use wire-framing to show you what it could look like, not what it will look like.

### Fast
It's quick - under 100kb minified. mesh was built with a very modular approach, meaning you can cut back on classes & components you won't use by using our scss files.

### Functional
It has a huge amount of very useful utility classes, it's also built entirely around flex box, which enables you to write HTML quicker. It's extremely easy to pick up and will save you bags of time in the long run.
