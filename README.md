## Versatile:
mesh is based on the principle that every website is different. Most CSS frameworks have consistent styling, you can almost tell if a website was designed with a particular one. Here, we use wireframing to show you what it could look like, not what it will look like.

## Fast:
Its quick - under 100kb minified. mesh was built with a very modular approach, meaning you can cut back on classes & components you wont use using our scss files.

## Functional:
mesh has a huge amount of very useful utility classes, which enables you to write HTML quicker. Its extremley easy to pick up and will save you bags of time in the long run.
