## Why meshCSS?

meshCSS is pureCSS framework featuring a responsive grid system, a vast amount of utilities and pure dynamic components such as modals, tabs, alerts and many more. 
It's extremely quick -  100kb minified. mesh was built with a very modular approach, meaning you can cut back on classes & components you won't use by using our meshBuilder or the scss files.
It has a huge amount of very useful utility classes, it's also built entirely around flex box, which enables you to write HTML quicker. It's extremely easy to pick up and will save you bags of time in the long run.
