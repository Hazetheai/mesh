## Why mesh?

### Versatile:
It's based on the principle that every website is different. Most CSS frameworks have consistent styling, you can almost tell if a website was designed with a particular one. Here, we use wire-framing to show you what it could look like, not what it will look like.

### Fast:
It's quick - under 100kb minified. mesh was built with a very modular approach, meaning you can cut back on classes & components you won't use by using our scss files.

### Functional:
It has a huge amount of very useful utility classes, which enables you to write HTML quicker. It's extremely easy to pick up and will save you bags of time in the long run.

## Contributing
mesh is still in its early days, if you wish to contribute, please do so! It would be appreciated. 
Please email info@ainsleyclark.com if you have any questions, I will be more than happy to answer them. 

**How to contribute:**
1. Clone this repo and create a new branch.
2. Using node/npm enter `npm install` to install dev dependencies.
3. Then use `npm run dev` to watch & compile scss.
4. When finished use `npm run prod` to clean compiled css files. 
5. Merge & commit, create new pull request.

**What to contribute:**
Any ideas are welcome. The majority of the utility classes are done so UI components are needed (remember CSS only!), including: 
- Cards
- Modals
- Toasts
- Chips
- Forms
- Nav
- Header
- Hero Section
- Tabs
- Tooltip
- Icons
- Breadcrumbs
- Pagination

**Notes:**
- Please do not edit ***mesh.css*** directly, they are automatically generated. 
- Get yourself familiar with the demo pages to see how things work.

### Grid:
mesh uses the conventional containers, rows and columns to layout and align content, it's built with flex box and is fully responsive.

```
<div class="container">
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-12 col-tab-6 col-desk-4 col-hd-3">
          I'm a column, I take up 12 columns at mobile, 6 at tablet, 4 at dekstop and 3 in hd screens
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
```
#### Containers:
A container can be at fixed size, and will gracefully become smaller as screen size gets smaller.

```
<div class="container">
</div>
```

Or a container can be full width, meaning the
