## Why meshCSS?

meshCSS is pureCSS framework featuring a responsive grid system, a vast amount of utilities and pure dynamic components such as modals, tabs, alerts and many more.<br/>
It's extremely quick -  100kb minified. mesh was built with a very modular approach, meaning you can cut back on classes & components you won't use by using our meshBuilder or the scss files.<br/>
It has a huge amount of very useful utility classes, it's also built entirely around flex box, which enables you to write HTML quicker. It's extremely easy to pick up and will save you bags of time in the long run.

## Getting Started

Head over to the [installation](http://meshcss.com/documentation/getting-started/installation) for more details on how to install and download mesh. But here are a few options to get you started.

- We recommend you to head over to the [meshBuilder](https://www.meshcss.com/builder) to only download the components/utilities you need with an extremely powerful tool helping you customize what components to import and colors to use.
- Download the [latest release](https://github.com/ainsleyclark/mesh/releases/latest) with pre-compiled CSS
- Install with [npm](https://npmjs.com) to get all source files as they are available on Github: ```npm install meshcss```
